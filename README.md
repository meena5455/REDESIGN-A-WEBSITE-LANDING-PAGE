Project Description: CODETECH Internship Poster – Designed in Figma
I designed this online internship program poster for CODETECH using Figma, a collaborative interface design tool. The goal was to create a clear, visually engaging, and informative layout that effectively communicates internship opportunities and program benefits.

1. Requirement Gathering & Content Planning
Collected all the necessary content from CODETECH (program details, internship domains, application info, and notes).

Segmented the content into key sections:

Header & Branding

Program Overview

What We Offer

Available Positions

Notes Section

2. Wireframing
Created a basic wireframe in Figma to define the layout structure.

Focused on a clean, scroll-friendly vertical layout suitable for web or mobile sharing.

3. UI Design in Figma
Used Auto Layout to organize sections responsively and maintain consistency.

Applied a consistent color scheme with orange gradients to match CODETECH’s branding.

Used cards and icons to visually group internship domains (development, design, testing, etc.).

Included rounded buttons for applying to internships (4/6/8/12 weeks).

Added visual hierarchy with headings, subheadings, and callouts.

Incorporated Figma plugins for icons and illustrations to enhance clarity and engagement.

4. Typography & Color Scheme
Selected modern, readable fonts for professional appearance.

Used high contrast for important elements like the title, apply buttons, and notes section.

Maintained consistent spacing and alignment for neatness.

5. Final Touches
Previewed the design on various screen sizes using Figma’s device preview tools.

Exported the design in PNG format for sharing on social media and as a PDF for print.
